# SAM-Smart-Assistance-and-Management-Calculator
One word... Math! Sum's getting tedious and less student friendly? Then here's the deal. SAM's Calculator. The calculator's engine can process long chains of equations like 246^23+324-542(32)*453/3 (that's enough to make one dizzy isn't it?). So happy Math! With the latest update, you can now carry on with Trigonometric ratios and exponents...
